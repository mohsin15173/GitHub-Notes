git rebase = if i have 3 files in master and 3 files in feature and i want to use rebase what it does is the feature branch
             connects to the master branch from the masters last file or commit my last file here is a3 from a3 branch feature will
             start that is master branch looks liks a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3 
as u have seen in the class when i rebased it all files of feature became base of master.

when i rebased in local repo what happened is all the files we created in feature were in master that is they were right below the 
files of master which is called rebasing of the master branch
